There are a few timeless classics among computer books, like \person{Fred
Brook}'s \emph{``The Mythical Man-Month''} about managing projects, or
\person{Donald Knuth}'s \emph{``The Art of Computer Programming''} about
algorithms. And \textbf{Thinking \Forth} about philosophy of problem
solving and programming style, the middle layer. Many hot concepts
described here can now be found in eXtreme Programming, like
(re)factoring, modularity, bottom-up and incremental design. Others
still have to reach a wider audience.

Here you'll find all of them, written down in \person{Leo Brodie}'s
humorous style, well structured into the phases of a traditional
software development cycle, full of detailed coding samples,
illustrative cartoons, and interviews with \Forth's creator,
\person{Charles H. Moore} and other
\Forth{} thinkers. If you program in \Forth{}, this is a must-read book,
if you don't, you'll benefit, too: \textbf{Thinking \Forth{}} is meant
for anyone interested in writing software to solve problems.  Concepts
go beyond particular expressions, though the \emph{elegant logic}
behind \Forth{} makes it easier to deploy them. So start now, and read
all about
\begin{itemize}
\item philosophy of \Forth{},
\item analysis,
\item decomposition,
\item problem solving,
\item style and conventions,
\item factoring,
\item handling data, and
\item minimizing control structures.
\end{itemize}
